Hi! I’m <strong>Hanyu Liu</strong>. I’ve always been driven by a passion for tackling complex, high-stakes challenges. This drive has led me to earn National Prizes in prestigious competitions like <strong>CUMCM, RAICOM, and CPIPC</strong>. Currently, my research is dedicated to <strong>Robotics, Embodied AI, and VLA models</strong>—fields that I don't just see as a career, but as a lifelong calling.
